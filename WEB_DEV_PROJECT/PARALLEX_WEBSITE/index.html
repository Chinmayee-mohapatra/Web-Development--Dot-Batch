                Every emotion in life plays an important role and the one that is accompanied by adrenaline is certainly for the brave. Adventure sports have been a favorite method for all the adrenaline junkies to satisfy their cravings for more thrill. Here is a list of adventure sports that you should try if life-changing experiences, celebrating victories, and thrill are the feelings that suit you.
                <br><br>
                We relate adventure sports to itsy-bitsy activities like diving, hiking, and rafting that children and their families can easily engage in. But there are some extremely dangerous adventure sports that are meant only for the most daring of individuals. Even though there is an extreme level of danger involved in these activities that bring the person close to death, these sports truly live up to the meaning of ‘adventure’! And mind you, they’re not for the faint-hearted.

                <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>
            </div> 
            <p class="text"><b>Biking</b> is an activity that involves a bicycle. You can ride the bike on a road, bike path, a mountain trail, or rough terrain. Some use the term “biking” to refer specifically to a mountain biking context, and it is often associated with riding a heavy duty bicycle on rougher terrain.
                <br><br>
                Mountain biking usually takes place on mountain trails, dirt roads, or parks. It first originated as a sport in California, United States. The first bikers who engaged in the sport used a type of bike called cruiser bicycles. This single-speed bicycle comes with balloon tyres and an upright seating posture. It has fewer gears, which make it the perfect bike when you want to simply enjoy riding without thinking about what gears to control. Nowadays, people who engage in mountain biking and off-the-road biking use mountain bikes.

                <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
            </div> 
            <p class="text"><b>Paragliding,</b> sport of flying parachutes with design modifications that enhance their gliding capabilities. Unlike hang gliders, their close relations, paragliders have no rigid framework; the parachute canopy acts as a wing and is constructed of fabric cells with openings at the front that allow them to be inflated by movement through the air—the “ram-air” effect.                
                <br><br>
                The sport can be traced to the activities of French parachute inventor Pierre Lemoigne, who tow-launched his advanced round-parachute canopies in the 1950s. The ram-air-inflated cell structure originated in the early 1960s with the kite and parachute designs of the Canadian-born American inventor Domina Jalbert. These designs evolved into steerable rectangular parachutes with relatively high forward speed. It was soon found that they had sufficient glide performance to allow them to be launched from steep slopes as well as by the aircraft deployment usual for parachutists.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div> 
            <p class="text"><b>Surfing's</b> roots lie in premodern Hawaii and Polynesia, where the sport was practiced by both men and women from all social strata from royalty to commoners. Early European explorers and travelers praised the skills of Hawaiian surfers, but 19th-century missionaries assigned to the islands disapproved of the “constant intermingling, without any restraint, of persons of both sexes” and banned the pastime. Surfing was practiced only sporadically in Hawaii by the end of the 19th century.
                <br><br>
                Because they were lightweight, easy to transport, and easy to ride, malibus popularized surfing and sparked a unique, hedonistic subculture. This subculture originated in Southern California but spread around the world, from South Africa to Australia, by surf-film cinematographers, surf magazines, and the travels of the peripatetic California surfers.
